<h2>
 Our Mission</h2>

 
	<p>

As a community, the International Association of Conciliar Theology, we journey with people of good will who are sensitive to the challenges of our times. We reflect on Christian tradition (supported by solid scholarship) in the light of cultural and religious experiences and socio-political developments. The Scriptures narrate God´s incarnation by which Christ Jesus shares the life of the world. Traces of God's liberating presence are found in stories and struggles of women and men that “have life and have it to the full” (John 10:10).
        </p><p>
Christian people share the “joy and hope, grief and anguish of human beings of our times, especially of those who are poor or afflicted in any way” (Gaudium et Spes 1). Our international journal walks in the footsteps of those who shaped the vision arising from the Second Vatican Council. During the Council (1962-1965) the Roman Catholic Bishops decided to open the Church to a changing world and read the signs of the times in the light of the Gospel. This has been a modern starting point for church renewal and for theological re-foundation.
    </p><p>
Since 1965, with a critical and constructive discourse, Concilium has contributed to new ways of doing theology. We want to reach our readers between the faithful and all persons of good will, leaders and members of churches and of social movements, and persons in institutions dedicated to or interested in theology. We seek to respond to the signs of our times, to the longing for a new humanity and for the integrity of creation. We are in solidarity with the irruption of the poor and with theological insights of women and men throughout the world and specially of marginalized peoples.
    </p><p>
As a Catholic Review of Theology, Concilium reaffirms its mission within the renewal of churches and spiritualities committed to hope, love, justice and peace on this earth. It fosters international, intercultural, interreligious exchanges. It is challenged by globalization, secularism, and new forms of spirituality. Deep theological questions arise because of cultural and social challenges, of a change of epoch, of social and religious initiatives, of the search for a new and more just interrelationship between nations and cultures.
    </p><p>
We contribute to ecumenical and to inter-religious dialogue. We deal with global factors and communications, hoping that a renewed church and “another world” are possible (World Social Forum). Thus our Review intends its contribution to the future of Christian tradition of which it is a part and to which it holds itself accountable.
